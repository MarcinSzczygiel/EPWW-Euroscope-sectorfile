VATSIM is the Virtual Air Traffic Simulation network, connecting people from around the world flying online or acting as virtual Air Traffic Controllers.
The main slogan for VATSIM is "as real as it gets". This means, we try to reach as much realism as it is possible, both when flying in simulator or controlling air traffic.
## About this sectorfile
This sectorfile is needed to provide virtual ATC service in EPWW virtual [FIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_information_region). The repository contains all changes since 2012. However, history of this sectorfile reaches 2008, when first attempts to use EuroScope were made in ([Polish Virtual Area Control Center](http://pl-vacc.org.pl/)).

The main frequency of publishing new editions of sectorfile is 4 weeks. It is strictly correlated with [AIRAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeronautical_Information_Publication) cycle.

## Note
Above informations are obvious for VATSIM members. However, i decided to provide a brief for people who are not familiar with this environment. Many more readings are available under above links.
